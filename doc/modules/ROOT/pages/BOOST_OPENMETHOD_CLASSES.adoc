[#BOOST_OPENMETHOD_CLASSES]

## BOOST_OPENMETHOD_CLASSES

### Synopsis

Defined in <boost/openmethod/macros.hpp>.

```c++
BOOST_OPENMETHOD_CLASSES(CLASSES...[, REGISTRY]);
```

### Description

Registers `CLASSES` in REGISTRY.

NOTE: The default value for `REGISTRY` is the value of
`BOOST_OPENMETHOD_DEFAULT_REGISTRY` when `<boost/openmethod/core.hpp>` is
included. Subsequently changing it has no retroactive effect.

This macro is a wrapper around `use_classes`; see its documentation for more
details.
